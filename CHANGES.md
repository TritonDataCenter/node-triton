# node-triton changelog

Known issues:

- `triton ssh ...` disables ssh ControlMaster to avoid issue #52.

## not yet released

(nothing yet)

## 7.5.1

- [TOOLS-2378] Allow an sshpk dependency range. The sshpk.Fingerprint "api
  version" was changed between sshpk 1.14 and 1.16, such that unlucky
  mixing of `Fingerprint` objects between sshpk module versions will
  fail `isFingerprint(fp)`.

## 7.5.0

- [joyent/node-triton#264] Update `triton rbac role[s]` to use the new
  CloudAPI role API (see https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#900).

- [joyent/node-triton#265] Un-hide the `triton --act-as ACCOUNT ...`
  option (and add a matching `TRITON_ACT_AS=ACCCOUNT` envvar) that allows
  one to masquerade as the given account. This is useful (a) for operator
  accounts and (b) members of cross-account roles.

## 7.4.1

- [TRITON-1869] node-triton needs `triton instance migration finalize`.

## 7.4.0

- [TRITON-1862] Add `triton account limits` support. This returns the
  provisioning limits set for the account and/or datacenter.

## 7.3.0

- [TRITON-899] Add node-triton support for triton instance migration.

## 7.2.0

- [TRITON-1325] node-triton fwrule support for cloud firewall logging.
  Firewall rules will now include the attribute `log (Boolean)`. When
  true, the system will log new TCP connections or new other-protocol
  sessions matching the rules.
  [RFD 163](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0163)

  This change modifies the default output of the `triton inst fwrules`
  and `triton fwrule list` adding a `LOG` column to the default output.

  For example, for a set of rules that previously were as follows:

        SHORTID   ENABLED  GLOBAL  RULE
        285d7f76  false    -       FROM any TO vm efe45825-4c0d-48f5-d62c-c5a50433fad1 BLOCK tcp PORT 666
        4ef987de  true     -       FROM subnet 10.99.99.0/24 TO vm 3a2b9998-965d-c4ab-d952-eb2802f8d6b9 ALLOW tcp PORT all
        44eae6bb  true     -       FROM subnet 10.99.99.0/24 TO vm efe45825-4c0d-48f5-d62c-c5a50433fad1 ALLOW tcp PORT all

  The new output will be:

        SHORTID   ENABLED  GLOBAL  LOG   RULE 
        285d7f76  false    -       true  FROM any TO vm efe45825-4c0d-48f5-d62c-c5a50433fad1 BLOCK tcp PORT 666
        4ef987de  true     -       true  FROM subnet 10.99.99.0/24 TO vm 3a2b9998-965d-c4ab-d952-eb2802f8d6b9 ALLOW tcp PORT all
        44eae6bb  true     -       true  FROM subnet 10.99.99.0/24 TO vm efe45825-4c0d-48f5-d62c-c5a50433fad1 ALLOW tcp PORT all

  The `log (Boolean)` field will be returned when a single firewall rule is
  retrieved using `fwrule get`:

        fwrule get 44eae6bb
        {
            "id": "44eae6bb-337f-45ba-8ff9-dddcd46e5918",
            "rule": "FROM subnet 10.99.99.0/24 TO vm efe45825-4c0d-48f5-d62c-c5a50433fad1 ALLOW tcp PORT all",
            "enabled": true,
            "log": true
        }

  The sub-command `fwrule create` will include the new `-l|--log` option for
  rule creation and the `log` value has been added to the list of fields which
  can be updated using `fwrule update`.

## 7.1.1

- [joyent/node-triton#169] Fix `triton rbac ...` commands that were
  all broken by #108 in v5 (by github.com/YangYong3).

## 7.1.0

- [TRITON-967] Add support for listing, adding, deleting, and resizing
  disks for instances based into `flexible_disk` packages.
  [RFD 154](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0154)

- [joyent/node-triton#263] Correct envvar name to `TRITON_TLS_INSECURE`
  in CLI profile validation error message.

## 7.0.2

- [TRITON-1347] Changing to node-tap as the test runner. Also some
  improvements to the testing docs.

## 7.0.1

- [TRITON-884] Drop support for Cloud Analytics-related RBAC "resources"
  for role-tags. Cloud Analytics has been removed from Triton. See
  [TRITON-884](https://smartos.org/bugview/TRITON-884) for details.

## 7.0.0

- [Backward incompatible.] `triton image get NAME|SHORTID` will now *exclude*
  inactive images by default. Before this change inactive images (e.g. those
  with a state of "creating" or "unactivated" or "disabled") would be
  included. Use the new `-a,--all` option to include inactive images. This
  matches the behavior of `triton image list [-a,--all] ...`.

- [joyent/node-triton#258] `triton instance create IMAGE ...` will now exclude
  inactive images when looking for an image with the given name.

## 6.3.0

- [joyent/node-triton#259] Added basic support for use of SSH bastion hosts
  to access zones on private fabrics.  If the `tritoncli.ssh.proxy` tag is set
  on an instance, `triton ssh` will look up the name or UUID of the proxy
  instance and use `ssh -o ProxyJump` to tunnel the connection to the target.
  If the `tritoncli.ssh.ip` tag is set on an instance, `triton ssh` will use
  that IP address instead of the `primaryIp` when making its connection.

## 6.2.0

- [joyent/node-triton#255, joyent/node-triton#257] Improved the interface
  and documentation of `triton network create` and `triton vlan create`.  In
  particular, it is now possible to specify static routes and DNS resolvers.

## 6.1.2

- [joyent/node-triton#249] Error when creating or deleting profiles when
  using node v10.

## 6.1.1

- [TRITON-598] Fix error handling for `triton network get-default` when
  no default network is set on the account.

## 6.1.0

- [joyent/node-triton#250] Avoid an error from `triton profile list` if
  only *some* of the minimal `TRITON_` or `SDC_` envvars are defined.
- [TRITON-401] Add `triton network` and `triton vlan` commands, for
  creating/changing/removing network fabrics and VLANs.
- [TRITON-524] Add `triton inst get --credentials ...` option to match
  `triton inst list --credentials ...` for including generated credentials
  in instance metadata.
- [joyent/node-triton#245] `triton profile` now generates fresh new keys during
  Docker setup and signs them with an account key, rather than copying (and
  decrypting) the account key itself. This makes using Docker simpler with keys
  in an SSH Agent.
- [TRITON-53] x-account image clone. A user can make a copy of a shared image
  using the `triton image clone` command.
- [TRITON-53] A shared image (i.e. when the user is on the image.acl) is no
  longer provisionable by default - you will need to explicitly add the
  --allow-shared-images cli option when calling `triton create` command to
  provision from a shared image (or clone the image then provision from the
  clone).
- [TRITON-52] x-DC image copy. A user can copy an image that they own into
  another datacenter within the same cloud using the `triton image copy` cli
  command. Example:

  ```
  triton -p us-east-1 image cp my-custom-image us-sw-1
  ```

## 6.0.0

This release containes some breaking changes with the --affinity flag to
`triton instance create`. It also does not work with cloudapi endpoints older
than 8.0.0 (mid 2016); for an older cloudapi endpoint, use node-triton 5.9.0.

- [TRITON-167, TRITON-168] update support for
  `triton instance create --affinity=...`. It now fully supports regular
  expressions, tags and globs, and works across a wider variety of situations.
  Examples:

  ```
  # regular expressions
  triton instance create --affinity='instance!=/^production-db/' ...

  # globs
  triton instance create --affinity='instance!=production-db*' ...

  # tags
  triton instance create --affinity='role!=db'
  ```

  See <https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#affinity-rules> for more details
  how affinities work.

  However:
  - Use of regular expressions requires a cloudapi version of 8.8.0 or later.
  - 'inst' as a affinity shorthand no longer works. Use 'instance' instead.
    E.g.: --affinity='instance==db1' instead of --affinity='inst==db1'
  - The shorthand --affinity=<INST> no longer works. Use
    --affinity='instance===<INST>' instead.

## 5.10.0

- [TRITON-19] add support for deletion protection on instances. An instance with
  the deletion protection flag set true cannot be destroyed until the flag is
  set false. It is exposed through
  `triton instance create --deletion-protection ...`,
  `triton instance enable-deletion-protection ...`, and
  `triton instance disable-deletion-protection ...`. This flag is only supported
  on cloudapi versions 8.7.0 or above.
- [TRITON-59] node-triton should support nic operations
  `triton instance nic get ...`
  `triton instance nic create ...`
  `triton instance nic list ...`
  `triton instance nic delete ...`
- [TRITON-42] node-triton should support nics when creating an instance, e.g.
  `triton instance create --nic <Network Object> IMAGE PACKAGE`

## 5.9.0

- [TRITON-190] remove support for `triton instance create --brand=bhyve ...`.
  The rest of bhyve support will remain, but selection of bhyve brand will
  happen via images or packages that are bhyve-specific.

## 5.8.0

- [TRITON-124] add node-triton support for bhyve. This adds a `triton instance
  create --brand=bhyve ...` option that can be used for zvol images that support
  it. Note that bhyve support is alpha in TritonDC -- most datacenters won't yet
  support this option.

## 5.7.0

- [TRITON-116] node-triton image sharing. Adds `triton image share` and
  `triton image unshare` commands.

## 5.6.1

- [PUBAPI-1470] volume objects should expose their creation timestamp in a
  property named "created" instead of "create_timestamp".

## 5.6.0

- [TRITON-30] Add UpdateNetworkIP to node-triton, e.g.
  `triton network ip update`
- [TRITON-24] node-triton ListNetworkIPs has unordered results, e.g.
  `triton network ip list NETWORK`
- [TRITON-88] node-triton "env" doesn't call its callback

## 5.5.0

- [PUBAPI-1452] Add ip subcommand to network, e.g.
  `triton network ip`.

## 5.4.0

- [joyent/node-triton#74, TOOLS-1872] Filter instance list by tag, e.g.
  `triton instance list tag.foo=bar`.

## 5.3.2

- [joyent/node-triton#187] DTraceProviderBindings errors on FreeBSD.
- [joyent/node-triton#226] added new `triton volume sizes` subcommand.
- [PUBAPI-1420] added support for mounting volumes in LX and SmartOS instances.
  E.g., `triton instance create --volume VOLUME ...`.

## 5.3.1

- [joyent/node-triton#222] Fix the matching environment variable for the
  `triton -r,--role ROLE ...` option to be `TRITON_ROLE` instead of
  `MANTA_ROLE`.
- [joyent/node-triton#201] Fix `triton -r,--role ROLE ...` option for taking up
  an RBAC role. This was introduced in v4.12.0 and was accidentally broken
  in v5.0.0.
- [joyent/node-triton#217] `triton volume ls -l` should output a `RESOURCE`
  column.

## 5.3.0

- [joyent/node-triton#173], [joyent/node-triton#174] and
  [joyent/node-triton#175] Add support for creating and managing NFS shared
  volumes. New `triton volume` commands are available:

  * `triton volume create` to create NFS shared volumes
  * `triton volume list` to list existing volumes
  * `triton volume get` to get information about a given volume
  * `triton volume delete` to delete one or more volumes

  Use `triton volume --help` to get help on all of these commands.

  Note that these commands are hidden for now. They will be made visible by
  default once the server-side support for volumes is shipped in Triton.

## 5.2.1

- [joyent/node-triton#193] Fix possible CLI crash with `triton ssh ...` if the
  instance's image doesn't have any tags.
- [joyent/node-triton#213] commands fail unhelpfully when `cliSetupTritonApi`
  returns error (this includes e.g. supplying an incorrect key fingerprint,
  which no longer results in a cryptic stack trace and crash)

## 5.2.0

- [joyent/node-triton#197] Create triton image export command

## 5.1.1

- [joyent/node-triton#190] Fix `triton profile create|docker-setup` breakage
  with latest "17.03.\*" versions of `docker` installed.
- [joyent/node-triton#148] Fix `triton profile edit ...` to work with an
  "EDITOR" environment variable with quotes and spaces.
- [joyent/node-triton#183] `triton profile create` will no longer use ANSI
  codes for styling if stdout isn't a TTY.

## 5.1.0

- [joyent/node-triton#182] Add `-y, --yes` options to `triton profile create`
  and `triton profile docker-setup` to allow non-interactive setup.

## 5.0.0

- [joyent/node-triton#108] Support for passphrase-protected private keys.
  Before this work, an encrypted private SSH key (i.e. protected by a
  passphrase) would have to be loaded in an ssh-agent for the `triton`
  CLI to use it. Now `triton` will prompt for the passphrase to unlock
  the private key (in memory), if needed. For example:

        $ triton package list
        Enter passphrase for id_rsa: <passphrase entered interactively here>
        SHORTID   NAME             MEMORY  SWAP  DISK  VCPUS
        14ad9d54  g4-highcpu-128M    128M  512M    3G      -
        14ae2634  g4-highcpu-256M    256M    1G    5G      -
        ...

- **BREAKING CHANGE for module usage of node-triton.**
  To implement joyent/node-triton#108, the way a TritonApi client is
  setup for use has changed from being (unrealistically) sync to async.

  Client preparation is now a multi-step process:

  1. create the client object;
  2. initialize it (mainly involves finding the SSH key identified by the
     `keyId`); and,
  3. optionally unlock the SSH key (if it is passphrase-protected and not in
     an ssh-agent).

  `createClient` has changed to take a callback argument. It will create and
  init the client (steps 1 and 2) and takes an optional `unlockKeyFn` parameter
  to handle step 3. A new `mod_triton.promptPassphraseUnlockKey` export can be
  used for `unlockKeyFn` for command-line tools to handle prompting for a
  passphrase on stdin, if required. Therefore what used to be:

        var mod_triton = require('triton');
        try {
            var client = mod_triton.createClient({      # No longer works.
                profileName: 'env'
            });
        } catch (initErr) {
            // handle err
        }

        // use `client`

  is now:

        var mod_triton = require('triton');
        mod_triton.createClient({
            profileName: 'env',
            unlockKeyFn: mod_triton.promptPassphraseUnlockKey
        }, function (err, client) {
            if (err) {
                // handle err
            }

            // use `client`
        });

  See [the examples/ directory](examples/) for more complete examples.

  Low-level/raw handling of the three steps above is possible as follows
  (error handling is elided):

        var mod_bunyan = require('bunyan');
        var mod_triton = require('triton');

        // 1. create
        var client = mod_triton.createTritonApiClient({
            log: mod_bunyan.createLogger({name: 'my-tool'}),
            config: {},
            profile: mod_triton.loadProfile('env')
        });

        // 2. init
        client.init(function (initErr) {
            // 3. unlock key
            // See top-comment in "lib/tritonapi.js".
        });

- [joyent/node-triton#143] Fix duplicate output from 'triton rbac key ...'.

- [joyent/node-triton#157] Add `triton instance resize ...` command and
  `TritonApi.resizeInstance` method.

- [joyent/node-triton#129] Fix `triton reboot --wait` to properly wait. Before
  it would often return immediately, before the instance started rebooting.
  Add `--wait-timeout N` option to `triton reboot`.
  Also add `TritonApi#rebootInstance()` api method.

- [joyent/node-triton#166] Update sshpk to fix issue with the TLS client cert
  created by `triton profile docker-setup` so that it doesn't create a cert that
  Go's TLS library doesn't like.

- [joyent/node-triton#156] Providing all required profile options as command
  line flags (account, url, keyId) no longer produces an incomplete profile
  error.

- PUBAPI-1171/PUBAPI-1205/PUBAPI-1351 The handling of legacy `SDC_*`
  environment variables has been cleaned up.  These environment
  variables are used for compatibility with the node-smartdc toolset.
   * `SDC_TESTING` is now evaluated the same way as node-smartdc.  Any
     set value but the empty string is true.
   * Errors on boolean environment variables will now identify the
     variable at fault.
   * `triton env` will emit additional comments grouping variables.

- [joyent/node-triton#80] Add `triton network list public=true|false`
  filtering. Note that this filtering is client-side.

- [joyent/node-triton#146] Add `--wait` flag to `triton instance rename`.

- [joyent/node-triton#133] Add `triton inst fwrule list` and `triton fwrules`
  shortcuts for the existing `triton inst fwrules` and `triton fwrule list`,
  respectively.

- [joyent/node-triton#3] triton ssh command not aware of "ubuntu" login for
  ubuntu-certified images.

- [joyent/node-triton#137] Improve the handling for the getting started case
  when a user may not have envvars or a profile setup.

- [joyent/node-triton#158] tritonapi image cache never expires

- [joyent/node-triton#153] Bump restify-clients dep. Thanks, github.com/tomgco.


## 4.15.0

- [joyent/node-triton#64] Support 'triton instance rename ...' (by
  github.com/YangYong3).
- [trentm/node-dashdash#30, joyent/node-triton#144] Change the output used by
  Bash completion support to indicate "there are no completions for this
  argument" to cope with different sorting rules on different Bash/platforms.
  For example:

        $ triton -p test2 package get <TAB>          # before
        ##-no -tritonpackage- completions-##

        $ triton -p test2 package get <TAB>          # after
        ##-no-completion- -results-##

## 4.14.2

- TOOLS-1592 First workaround for a possible BadDigestError when using
  node v6.

## 4.14.1

- TOOLS-1587 'triton profile docker-setup' fails when path to 'docker' has
  spaces. This can help on Windows where Docker Toolbox installs docker.exe
  to "C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox".
- [#136] bash completion for `triton profile create --copy <TAB>`

## 4.14.0

- [#130] Include disabled images when using an image cache (e.g. for filling in
  image name and version details in `triton ls` output.


## 4.13.0

- [#120] Don't fail `triton instance list` if the retrieval of *image* info
  (retrieved to get image name and version, as a bonus) fails with an
  authorization error -- in case it is an RBAC failure where a subuser can
  ListMachines, but not ListImages.

- [#113] *Usage* errors now some "error help", including option or command
  synopses. Some examples (the new thing is marked with `>`):

  - Command synopses when argument errors:

    ```
        $ triton create
        triton instance create: error (Usage): incorrect number of args
    >   usage: triton instance create [OPTIONS] IMAGE PACKAGE
    ```

  - Option synopsis with option errors:

    ```
        $ triton image ls --bogus
        triton image ls: error (Option): unknown option: "--bogus"
    >   usage: triton image ls [ --help | -h ] [ --all | -a ] [ -H ] [ -o field1,... ]
    >       [ --long | -l ] [ -s field1,... ] [ --json | -j ] ...
    ```

  - Suggested command name misspellings:

    ```
        $ triton in
        triton: error (UnknownCommand): unknown command: "in"
    >   Did you mean this?
    >       info
    >       inst
    ```


## 4.12.0

- [#120] `triton -r,--role ROLE ...` option to take up an RBAC role(s).


## 4.11.0

- [#112] Fix `triton completion`, broke a while back.
- [#111] `triton env --unset,-u` option to emit environment commands to *unset*
  relevant envvars.
- Unhide `triton env` from `triton --help` output.


## 4.10.0

- [#82] Affinity (a.k.a. locality hints) support for instance creation, e.g.:

        # Use same server as instance 'db0':
        triton create -a instance==db0 ...
        triton create -a db0 ...           # shortcut for same thing

        # Use different server than instance 'db0':
        triton create -a 'instance!=db0' ...

        # *Attempt* to use same server as instance 'db0', but don't fail
        # if cannot. This is called a "non-strict" or "soft" rule.
        triton create -a instance==~db0 ...

        # *Attempt* to use a different server than instance 'db0':
        triton create -a 'instance!=~db0' ...

  "Affinity" here refers to providing rules for deciding on which server
  a new instance should by provisioned. Rules are in terms of existing
  instances. As a shortcut, 'inst' can be used in place of 'instance'
  above (e.g. `triton create -a 'inst!=db0' ...`).

## 4.9.0

- [#46] Initial support for `triton` helping setup and manage configuration for
  using `docker` against a Triton datacenter. Triton datacenters can provide
  a Docker Remote API endpoint against which you can run the normal `docker`
  client. See <https://www.joyent.com/triton> for and overview and
  <https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker> for developer details.

  - `triton profile create` will now setup the profile for running Docker,
    if the Triton datacenter provides a docker endpoint. The typical flow
    would be:

        $ triton profile create
        name: foo
        ...
        $ triton profile set foo            # make foo my default profile
        $ eval "$(triton env --docker)"     # set 'DOCKER_' envvars
        $ docker info

    This profile setup for Docker requires making requests to the
    CloudAPI endpoint which can fail (e.g. if CloudAPI is down, credentials
    are invalid, etc.). You can use the `--no-docker` option to skip
    the Docker setup part of profile creation.

  - For existing Triton CLI profiles, there is a new `triton profile
    docker-setup [PROFILE]`.

        $ triton profile docker-setup
        $ eval "$(triton env --docker)"
        $ docker info

  - `triton env` will now emit commands to setup `DOCKER_` envvars. That
    can be limited to just the Docker-relevant env via `triton env --docker`.


## 4.8.0

- #103 `triton ip <inst>` to output the instance's primaryIp
- #52 Workaround for `triton ssh ...`. In version 4.6.0, `triton ssh ...`
  interactive sessions were broken. This version reverts that change and adds
  a workaround for #52 (by disabling ControlMaster when spawning `ssh`).
  See <https://github.com/joyent/node-triton/issues/52> for details.
- #97 `triton profile set -` to set the *last* profile as current.
- PUBAPI-1266 Added `instance enable-firewall` and `instance disable-firewall`


## 4.7.0

**Known issue: `triton ssh` interactive sessions are broken.
Upgrade to v4.7.1.**

- #101 Bash completion for server-side data: instances, images, etc.
  Bash completion on TAB should now work for things like the following:
  `triton create <TAB to complete images> <TAB to complete packages`,
  `triton inst tag ls <TAB to complete instances>`. Cached (with a 5 minute
  TTL) completions for the following data are supported: instances, images,
  packages, networks, fwrules, account keys.
  See `triton completion --help` for adding/updating Bash completion.
- #99 `triton profile set ...` alias for `set-current`


## 4.6.0

**Known issue: `triton ssh` interactive sessions are broken.
Upgrade to v4.7.1.**

- #98 `triton inst get ID` for a deleted instance will now emit the instance
  object and error less obtusely. This adds a new `InstanceDeleted` error code
  from `TritonApi`.
- PUBAPI-1233 firewalls: `triton fwrule ...`
- PUBAPI-1234 instance snapshots: `triton inst snapshot ...`
- #52 Fix 'triton ssh ...' stdout/stderr to fully flush with node >= 4.x.


## 4.5.2

- #95 Fix breakage of `triton image create` in v4.5.0. (By Kris Shannon.)
- #94, #93 `triton inst create ...` is broken if "images.json" cache file
  is missing. (By Kris Shannon.)


## 4.5.1

- #92 `triton` CLI should summarize `err.body.errors` from CloudAPI
  Per <https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md#error-handling>,
  CloudAPI error response will sometimes have extra error details to show.


## 4.5.0

- #88 'triton inst tag ...' for managing instance tags.


## 4.4.4

- #90 Update sshpk and smartdc-auth to attempt to deal with multiple package
  inter-deps.


## 4.4.3

- #86 Ensure `triton profile ls` and `triton profile set-current` work
  when there is no current profile.


## 4.4.2

- Support `triton.createClient(...)` creation without requiring a
  `configDir`. Basically this then fallsback to a `TritonApi` with the default
  config.


## 4.4.1

- #83, #84 Fix running `triton` on Windows.
  Note: Triton config is stored in "%APPDATA%/Joyent/Triton/..." on Windows,
  "~/.triton/..." on other platforms.


## 4.4.0

- #78 `triton image delete IMAGE`
- #79 Fix `triton instance get NAME` to make sure it gets the `dns_names` CNS
  field.
- PUBAPI-1227: Note that `triton image list` doesn't include Docker images, at
  least currently.


## 4.3.1

- #77 triton create error in v4.3.0


## 4.3.0

**Bad release. Use >=4.3.1.**

- #76 `triton image create ...` and `triton image wait ...`
- #72 want `triton image` to still return image details even when it is not in 'active' state


## 4.2.0

- Bash completion: Add completion for *args* to `triton account update <TAB>`.
  This isn't perfect because a space is added after completion of "FIELD=",
  but hopefully is helpful.
- #75 `triton account update ...`


## 4.1.0

- Unhide `triton completion` so hopefully more find it and use it.

- node-triton#73 `triton instance list --credentials` to include
  "metadata.credentials" in instance listing.

- node-triton#35 More easily distinguish KVM and LX and Docker images and
  instances.

    In PUBAPI-1161 CloudAPI (v8.0.0) started exposing IMG.type, INST.brand and
    INST.docker. One of the main issues for users is that telling KVM ubuntu
    from LX ubuntu is confusing (see also joyent/smartos-live#532).

    tl;dr:

    - `triton image list` default output now includes the `type` instead of
      `state`. The `state` column is still in output with `-l`, `-j`,
      `-o state`.
    - `triton instance list` default output now includes a `flags` column
      instead of `primaryIp`. The 'D' and 'K' flags identify Docker and KVM
      instances.
    - `triton instance list -l` includes the brand.

    Default output examples showing the various cases (and the attempt to
    stay within 80 columns):

    ```bash
    $ triton imgs
    SHORTID   NAME            VERSION   FLAGS  OS       TYPE          PUBDATE
    1bd84670  minimal-64-lts  14.4.2    P      smartos  zone-dataset  2015-05-28
    b67492c2  base-64-lts     14.4.2    P      smartos  zone-dataset  2015-05-28
    ffe82a0a  ubuntu-15.04    20151105  P      linux    lx-dataset    2015-11-05
    8a1dbc62  centos-6        20160111  P      linux    zvol          2016-01-11

    $ triton insts
    SHORTID   NAME         IMG                    STATE    FLAGS  AGE
    da7c6edd  cocky_noyce  3d996aaa               running  DF     10m
    deedeb42  ubu0         ubuntu-15.04@20151105  running  -      9m
    aa9ccfda  mini2        minimal-64-lts@14.4.2  running  -      9m
    e8fc0b96  centi0       centos-6@20160111      running  K      8m
    ```

- Filtering instances on `docker=true`:

    ```bash
    $ triton insts docker=true
    SHORTID   NAME         IMG       STATE    FLAGS  AGE
    da7c6edd  cocky_noyce  3d996aaa  running  DF     13m
    ```


## 4.0.1

- Add `triton env -t` to be able to emit a shell environment to configure `triton` itself.
  This allows one to have the following Bash function to select a Triton profile for
  `triton` and node-smartdc tooling:

        function triton-select { eval $(triton env $1); }


## 4.0.0

- [backwards incompat] #66 New consistent `triton` CLI style. See [the
  issue](https://github.com/joyent/node-triton/issues/66) for discussion.

    The major changes is that where some sub-commands used to be some
    flavour of:

        triton things       # list all the things
        triton thing ID     # get a thing
        triton thing -a ID  # create a new thing

    Now commands are consistently:

        triton thing list       # list all the things
        triton thing get ID     # get a thing
        triton thing create ... # create a new thing
        ...

    The most annoying incompatility is the need for "get" to
    get a thing. E.g.:

        BEFORE                  AFTER
        triton img blah         triton img get blah
        triton inst web0        triton inst get web0

    For *listing* things, there is typically a shortcut with
    the old form, e.g. `triton images` is a shortcut for
    `triton image list`.

    Currently all of the CLI *except* the experimental `triton rbac ...`
    is converted to the new consistent style.

- [backwards incompat] `triton whoami` was dropped. This used to be a shortcut
  for `triton account get`. It could possibly come back.

- *Much* improved [Bash
  completion](https://github.com/joyent/node-triton#bash-completion). See
  `triton completion -h` for notes on how to install.

- Add the ability to create a profile copying from an existing profile,
  via `triton profile create --copy NAME`.

- `triton key add` was added (<https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#CreateKey>).


## 3.6.0

- #67 Add `triton create --network,-N NETWORK ...` option for specifying
  networks for instance creation. "NETWORK" is a network id, name, or
  short id; or a comma-separated array of networks.


## 3.5.0

- #67 Add `triton create --tag|-t ...` option for adding tags on instance creation.
  E.g. `triton create -n NAME -t foo=bar -t @my-tags-file.json IMAGE PACKAGE`.


## 3.4.2

- #63 "triton images" with a filter should not be cached.
- #65 Fix `triton profile(s)` handling when the user has no profiles yet.


## 3.4.1

- #60 Display `vcpus` in `triton packages` output.
- Add `-d,--data <data>` option to `triton cloudapi`.
- Fix `triton rbac role ROLE`. Also get that command to have a stable order for the
  displayed fields.


## 3.4.0

- Improvements for using node-triton as a module. E.g. a simple example:

        var triton = require('triton');
        var client = triton.createClient({profileName: 'env'});
        client.listImages(function (err, imgs) {
            console.log(err);
            console.log(imgs);
        });

  See the README and "lib/index.js" for more info.


## 3.3.0

- #59 CLI options to `triton create` to add metadata on instance creation:
    - `triton create -m,--metadata KEY=VALUE` to add a single value
    - `triton create -m,--metadata @FILE` to add values from a JSON
      or key/value-per-line file
    - `triton create -M,--metadata-file KEY=FILE` to set a key from a file
    - `triton create --script FILE` to set the special "user-script" key
      from a file


## 3.2.0

- #58 `triton --act-as=ACCOUNT ...` for an operator account to auth as
  themself, but operator on another account's resources. Note that operator
  accesses like this are audited on the CloudAPI server side.
- `triton --accept-version VER` hidden top-level option for development. This
  allows calling the target cloudapi with the given value for the
  "Accept-Version" header -- which is how CloudAPI does API versioning.
  By default `triton` is coded to a particular cloudapi version range, so
  forcing a different version *could* result in breaking in the triton client
  code that handles the response. IOW, this is just a tool for developers
  of this Triton client and CloudAPI itself.


## 3.1.0

- New (hidden for now, i.e. experimental) `triton env ...` to dump
  `eval`able shell commands for
  [node-smartdc](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc) environment setup for
  a given Triton CLI profile. E.g.:

        eval $(triton env east1)
        sdc-listmachines

  I think this should grow to support setting up Docker env as well.
- #54 `triton rbac role-tags` for now can't be hidden (as long we have the
  need to role-tag raw resource URLs like '/my/images').
- #54 `triton rbac apply --dev-create-keys-and-profiles` for
  experimenting/dev/testing to quickly generate and add user keys and setup
  Triton CLI profiles for all users in the RBAC config.
- #54 RBAC support, see <https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/rbac> to start.
    - `triton rbac info` improvements: better help, use brackets to show
      non-default roles.
    - `triton rbac reset`
    - change `triton rbac user USER` output a little for the 'keys' (show
      the key fingerprint and name instead of the key content), 'roles',
      and 'default_roles' fields.
- #54 *Drop* support for shortIds for `triton rbac {users,roles,policies}`
  commands. They all have unique *`name`* fields, just use that.
- #54 `triton rbac apply` will implicitly look for a user key file at
  "./rbac-user-keys/$login.pub" if no `keys` field is provided in the
  "rbac.json" config file.
- Change default `triton keys` and `triton rbac keys` output to be tabular.
  Otherwise it is a little obtuse to see fingerprints (which is what currently
  must be included in a profile). `triton [rbac] keys -A` can be used to
  get the old behaviour (just the key content, i.e. output appropriate
  for "~/.ssh/authorized\_keys").


## 3.0.0

- #54 RBAC support, see <https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/rbac> to start.
    - [Backward incompatible.] The `triton` CLI option for the cloudapi URL has
      changed from `--url,-u` to **`--url,-U`**.
    - Add `triton --user,-u USER` CLI option and `TRITON_USER` (or `SDC_USER`)
      environment variable support for specifying the RBAC user.
    - `triton profiles` now shows the optional `user` fields.
    - A (currently experimental and hidden) `triton rbac ...` command to
      house RBAC CLI functionality.
    - `triton rbac users` to list all users.
    - `triton rbac user ...` to show, create, edit and delete users.
    - `triton rbac roles` to list all roles.
    - `triton rbac role ...` to show, create, edit and delete roles.
    - `triton rbac policies` to list all policies.
    - `triton rbac policy ...` to show, create, edit and delete policies.
    - `triton rbac keys` to list all RBAC user SSH keys.
    - `triton rbac key ...` to show, create, edit and delete user keys.
    - `triton rbac {instance,image,network,package,}role-tags ...` to list
      and manage role tags on each of those resources.
    - `triton rbac info` will dump a summary of the full current RBAC
      state. This command is still in development.
    - `triton rbac apply` will synchronize a local RBAC config (by default it
      looks for "./rbac.json") to live RBAC state. Current the RBAC config
      file format is undocumented. See "examples/rbac-\*" for examples.
- #55 Update of smartdc-auth/sshpk deps, removal of duplicated code for
  composing Authorization headers


## 2.1.4

- #51: Update deps to get dtrace-provider 0.6 build fix for node v4.2.x.
- #49: `triton create ... --firewall` to enable [Cloud
  Firewall](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/network/firewall).


## 2.1.3

- #44 'triton rm' alias for delete
- #43 `triton profile ...` doesn't use the profile from `TRITON_PROFILE` envvar

## 2.1.2

- #41 Add compatibility with ed25519 keys in ssh-agent
- #42 Tools using sshpk should lock in an exact version

## 2.1.1

- #40 Update smartdc-auth so that newer OpenSSH `ssh-keygen` default
  fingerprint formats for setting `keyId` work.
- #39 Test suite: Change the test config 'destructiveAllowed' var to
  'writeActionsAllowed'.


## 2.1.0

- Errors and exit status: Change `Usage` errors to always have an exit status
  of `2` (per common practice in at least some tooling). Add `ResourceNotFound`
  error for `triton {instance,package,image,network}` with exit status `3`.
  This can help tooling (e.g. the test suite uses this in one place). Add
  `triton help` docs on exit status.

- Test suite: Integration tests always require a config file
  (either `$TRITON_TEST_CONFIG` path or "test/config.json").
  Drop the other `TRITON_TEST_*` envvars.


## 2.0.0

- Changed name to `triton` npm package, graciously given up by
  [suguru](https://www.npmjs.com/~suguru) from his
  <https://github.com/ameba-proteus/node-triton> project. <3
  The latest previous release of the triton package was 1.0.7,
  so we'll separate with a major version bump for *this* triton
  package.

## 1.0.0

Initial release as `joyent-triton` npm package.
